"""
You are given an array a1,a2,…an. Count the number of pairs of indices 1≤i,j≤n such that ai<i<aj<j.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of pairs of indices satisfying the condition in the statement.

Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).
